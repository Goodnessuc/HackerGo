## Getting started

There are two options available if you want to get started using HackerGo.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Goodnessuc/HackerGo.git
```
After you've cloned the repository, you can build the tool by running:

 ```
 $ go build
 $ go install
 ```
- Or just install tool directly in your project.

## HackerGo Usage
### There are three commands, `jobs`, `page`, and  `random` (so far).
<br>

#### The `jobs` command scrapes recent jobs from the [Hacker-news website](https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs) based on the additional arguments you provide

```
$ HackerGo jobs  <all | integer>
```
<br>

The  `all` argument scrapes all jobs on the first page of the website.
If you specify an integer less than 30 after specifying the page, you'll get the first "integer" jobs from the website.

<br>

Here's an example of the `jobs` command:

```
<br>
$ HackerGo jobs 5
